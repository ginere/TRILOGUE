	ec:"The Republic of Moldova has faced a difficult period over the last two years on both the economic and political fronts. A major banking fraud scandal erupted in November 2014, exposing severe governance problems that have since been accompanied by political instability – including the formation of three different governments since the November 2014 elections and the replacement of the governor of the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) – and street protests. Those developments have also led to a deceleration in economic growth, the suspension of budget support by Moldova’s international partners, and a weakening of the fiscal and balance of payments position. Economic difficulties have been exacerbated by a recession or weak economic activity in some of Moldova ́s key regional trading partners (notably Russia, but also Belarus and Ukraine), developments which reduced exports and remittances. This effect has only been partly offset by increased trade with the EU following the entry into force of the Association Agreement signed in 2014, which foresees the creation of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA).",

	ec:"In that context, Moldova requested support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After difficult and protracted negotiations, which reflected the existing political instability, in July 2016 the authorities finally reached agreement with the IMF on a programme to be supported by a three-year Extended Credit Facility and Extended Fund Facility (ECF/EFF) arrangement. The agreement was approved by the IMF Board on 7 November 2016. This agreement was made possible by a new determination on the part of the authorities, following the appointment of a new government led by Prime Minister Filip in January 2016 and of a new central bank governor in March 2016, to address governance problems in the financial sector and in public finance management (PFM). Access under the financial arrangement agreed with the IMF would represent 75% of Moldova’s quota in the IMF (SDR 129.4 million, or about EUR 161 million). The aim of the ECF/EFF is to make swift improvements in financial sector governance and supervision, strengthen policies to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability, and foster sustainable and inclusive growth.",

After the adjustment in 2015, Moldova’s economy is expected to recover only slowly in 2016 and the coming years. In 2016, GDP is expected to grow by about 2%. Growth in 2016 will continue to be constrained by budget cuts and tight credit conditions as well as by low remittance flows and higher local energy tariffs, which will keep private consumption subdued.

Consistent with the programme agreed with the IMF, a revised 2016 budget was adopted by the government and signed by the President on 4 October 2016, foreseeing the necessary adjustment measures on both the expenditure and revenue sides so as to meet the 3.2% of GDP deficit target.",

Last year's increase in government debt was largely driven by its domestic debt component. External government debt increased less (from 18% of GDP in 2014 to 21% of GDP at the end of 2015) and the increase was mainly attributable to the deprecation of the leu.

More specifically, within that period, the NBM sold from its foreign exchange reserves, both in special sales to the three State-controlled banks that went into liquidation and on the foreign exchange market, a total of USD 700 million. That decline partly reflected an increase in the rate of dollarization of savings as confidence in the leu weakened. Since then, reflecting the stabilisation and recovery in the foreign exchange market, the central bank accumulated USD 2.1 billion in foreign reserves by September 2016, which represents an estimated 5.1 months of projected imports.",

However, there have been delays in adoption of measures in some areas, such as public administration reform, the appointment of the president of the National Commission for Financial Markets (NCFM), as well as steps towards the liberalisation of the electricity and gas sectors. The EU has been increasingly involved in the provision of technical and policy advice to Moldova on structural reforms through the funding of a team of 25 so-called High Level Advisors who work side by side with high level officials in different institutions. The latter include the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the NBM.

This financing gap can broadly be attributed to three factors: a relatively large current account deficit, the need to build up foreign exchange reserves, and the large debt amortization requirements expected.
